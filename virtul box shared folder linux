1. You need to install guest additions for your guest system.
2. Create a shared folder between your host to your guest systems.
3. Change the user permission for a shared folder - so you can access the shared files from your guest system without root privileges.

After these steps all files created in this shared folder will be  available in both the host and the guest systems.


1:06 Arch Linux guest system

Make sure your Arch Linux guest system is up to date:
sudo pacman -Syu

Install linux headers:
sudo pacman -S linux-lts-headers
or
sudo pacman -S linux-headers

Install virtualbox-guest-utils:
sudo pacman -S virtualbox-guest-utils

for linux kernel choose virtualbox-guest-modules-arch
for other kernels choose virtualbox-guest-dkms

Load the Virtualbox kernel modules:
sudo systemctl enable vboxservice

Then add a shared folder. Reboot.

Add your user to the vboxsf group and give that user a permission to access the media folder:
sudo usermod -a -G vboxsf yourusername
sudo chown -R yourusername:users /media/

Log out, log in.


3:02 Debian guest system

(Please, use this way for any other distro. It's a more universal way.)

Make sure these packages are installed:
sudo apt install build-essential dkms linux-headers-$(uname -r)

Then add a shared folder. Reboot.

Insert Guest addition image and install VBoxLinuxAdditions:
sudo sh VBoxLinuxAdditions.run

Reboot.

Add your user to the vboxsf group:
sudo usermod -a -G vboxsf yourusername 

And change the permission of the media folder:
sudo chown -R yourusername:users /media/

Log out, log in.

4:39 Linux Mint / Ubuntu guest system

Open the software manager and install 
virtualbox-guest-X11
virtualbox-guest-utils
virtualbox-guest-dkms

Add a shared folder.

Reboot.

Then add your user to the vboxsf group.

sudo usermod -a -G vboxsf alu 

Change the permission.

sudo chown -R alu:users /media/

Log out, log in.


Now you can use a shared folder to move files between your host and guest systems.
